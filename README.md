TheCoffeeDungeon  
================
The sequel to my hit game, The Dungeon a slightly  
terrible console based text game written in C++, but now  
resurected in Java. It will include many improvements  
including a (kinda crappy) GUI, and an inventory system  
with multiple weapons, spells, and items.

---
* Now with a GUI!
* May or may not run at any given time  
* Totally awesome
* Give me money!
